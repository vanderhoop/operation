## Operation

[Operation!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_%28game%29) requires players to carefully replace the missing organs of a surgery patient. You've been tasked with doing the exact same thing, but using CSS.

#### Directions

1. Open up the [index.html](index.html) file in Chrome. Take a look at the layout.
1. Alter the css within [css/style.css](css/style.css), using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` attributes to position the patient's heart, wishbone, bread, and butterfly in the appropriate slots.
  - __Note:__ for the attributes above to have any effect, you'll first have to set the elements' `position` attribute.
